<p>My story involves me in pursuit of a game called Ghost Recon Future Soldier but I lack the funds to purchase it.</p>
<p>I must first sale my Casio Keyboard then find the best method of purchasing the game. That being either online or at the local GameStop store.</p>
<p>I then have to have to find a good offer of at least $55 in order to both by the game and a least 2 bags of chips. 
<p>The difference this time is I choose a buyer who's offer lower than my minimum because their buying it for their daughter and have to negotiate a bit this time. </p>
   P.S. my story will be told in third person.</p>
