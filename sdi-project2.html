<p>My story involves me in pursuit of a game called Ghost Recon Future Soldier but I lack the funds to purchase it.</p>
<p>I must first sale my Casio Keyboard then find the best method of purchasing the game. That being either online or at the local GameStop store.</p>
<p>I then have to have to find a good offer of at least $55 in order to both by the game and a least 2 bags of chips. 
   P.S. my story will be told in third person.</p>
